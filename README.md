Rendering of components with named slots.

`Molecule` allows rendering of components with named slots in phoenix or other eex based templating (needs `render/2`/`render/3` functions like phoenix views though).

## Example

```elixir
<%= component Module, "template.ext", assigns fo %>
  <% slot :name do %>
    Contents for named slot
  <% end %>
  Body contents <%= dynamic_content %>
<% end %>
```

This will essentially call (disregarding some whitespace).

```elixir
render(Module, "template.ext", Map.put(assigns, :slots, %{
  name: "Contents for named slot",
  body: "Body contents â€¦"
})
```

The called template can then do whatever it needs to do with those slots.

## Slot Function

Besides the `do/end` block format slots also support a function format:

```
<% slot :name, fn data -> %>
  Contents for named slot
<% end %>
```

Where the component template can pass data to the slot: `@slots.name.(data)`.
